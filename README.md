# üè¢ Coworking Space Analysis & Recommendation System
# Coworking Space Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a recommendation system for coworking spaces based on various features such as location, rating, transport facilities, and distance from the center. It includes a comprehensive analysis and prediction system to help users find the best coworking spaces in their preferred city.

## Features
- Coworking space recommendations based on user preferences (rating, distance, transport, etc.).
- Visualization of recommended coworking spaces on an interactive map.
- Predicted prices for coworking space daily passes.
- Interactive Streamlit web app for seamless user experience.

## Data Sources

The data for this project was gathered from multiple sources, including:
- Coworking space information (location, rating, number of reviews).
- External APIs and manual data collection for additional insights.

## Process

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

The first step was to gather data from various sources, such as Google Maps and coworking space directories. Here‚Äôs a screenshot of the preprocessing pipeline:

### 2. Feature Engineering and Analysis

Data transformation and feature extraction were performed to make sure we had useful features for the recommendation model. Below is a table that shows the most important features used in the model:

### 3. Model Training and Prediction

The recommendation system was built using a machine learning model. Here‚Äôs an image that shows the trained model's results:

### 4. Map Visualization of Recommended Spaces

Once the recommendations were generated, we used Folium to display the recommended coworking spaces on an interactive map:

### 5. Deployment and Streamlit App

The final recommendation system was deployed using Streamlit, making it easy for users to input their preferences and view the recommendations directly on the web.
