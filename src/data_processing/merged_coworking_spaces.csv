""LIVINK Coworking is a shared working space located on the first floor of a residential building, at number 23 of Calle Irún. Being on the first floor, we received a lot of natural light from both sides of the office and very little noise. Irún Street must be one quietest and with less traffic of all Madrid (within the M-30), and is located below the neighborhood of Argüelles, between Parque del Oeste (Temple of Debod), Jardines del Moro and Casa de Campo, above the multimodal station of Príncipe Pío (buses, metro L10 and L6 and Cercanías trains C1).

You can come to try a day completely free of charge and without obligations. On our website (LIVINK.es that will easily appear searching for LIVINK Coworking on Google) you will find more information, as well as photos and other contact ways.

We have 700m2 for two separate offices (350m2 each), with 80 working spots, 3 glazed meeting rooms of 15-20m2 (for 6, 8, 10 people), 2 cabins to make calls and videoconferences, a lunch-room for 20-25 people, 4 bathrooms (one of them with a shower, just in case you want to do some sport during the day), several relax/chill-out areas and a beautiful terrace.

We offer FIXED spots, for €150/month, and FLEX spots for € 80 / month.

We do not have any pay-in-advance fee, nor permanence nor hidden costs of any kind. The only cost is the number of positions you decide to pay for. We work just like your subscription to NETFLIX or SPOTIFY: once inside you can use the space as much as you want, including nights and weekends.

We do not have offices or private glazed areas. Our entire office is diaphanous and is equipped with bench-type tables, formed by single-user modules 120cm wide, and adjustable ergonomic chairs. In these tables two monitors fit without doubts.

The space is perfectly connected by public transport and you can park your car easily and cheaply thanks to a Long Stay Parking Area (€0.50/hour vs. €2.5/hour of green area).

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.."", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

As the community grows there are possibilities for afternoon yoga breaks, silent meditation (if you don't wish to contemplate your toes for time out) and workshops for sharing ideas. The best perk is the free warm cookies every Thursday afternoon.

Much like the cupuaçu (cacao) fruit, this formidable megacity of 20 million has a tough outer layer that is unbreakable without the force of a hammer. A shambled infrastructure, constant traffic, air pollution, violent crime, and extreme poverty makes for understandable wariness about moving to São Paulo. But once chipped away, many come to love this multicultural hub of South America – grievances, contradictions, and all.

São Paulo is ideal for having the benefits of a metropolis at your fingertips while getting to take part in the relaxed yet vibrant Brazilian lifestyle. The sprawling concrete jungle has incredibe pockets of beauty, activity, and diversity, and though the disparity between classes is obvious, paulistanos are known for their optimism and passion for life, however it’s lived. Though it’s often bypassed on the tourist track for Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo has some of Brazil’s best world-class restaurants, cultural and entertainment attractions, and gratifying stumbled-upon finds.

For the digital nomad, it doesn’t hurt that São Paulo is the largest financial center in all of South America with the most powerful startup ecosystem. And with an emergent middle class, the market size continues to grow. Today the city hosts innumerable entrepreneurship and tech events and has the largest number of cafes and coworking spaces to hustle from in Brazil. Google even jumped into the mix and established one of its first six global campuses here in late 2015. With all the enthusiasm and opportunity surrounding the startup culture, this hub is as hot and addictive as doughy coxinhas fresh from the frying pan.

Much like Rio, the hoops of the rental process can be an incredible headache, amplified further by outrageous accommodation costs. A major reason for the high cost of living in São Paulo in particular is the lack of middle ground rental options. Expatriates tend to live in a limited number of expensive neighborhoods in the south and west zones of the city that have higher security and better infrastructure. Because of the hellish traffic, people choose to live close to their work, so properties near corporate hubs are significantly pricier. As a nomad, you’ll have more living flexibility, but all the other nomads do too, which can make for a widely dispersed entrepreneur community. Make sure you scope out your hub options before diving into this fascinating monster of a city

For us, coworking is a verb.
A daily practice.

We create our own model, which inspires us to build daily a space to develop our essence:
Community + innovation + music

# 1 Community

We bring the sense of collectivity inside and outside our space, we cultivate good relations in Moema and surroundings with focus on the sustainability of the region.

# 2 Innovation
Innovation for us is to get out of the automatic mode of life.
Stop, breathe and think about what we do and why we do it.
Bring different looks and construct new meanings because we understand that the world today is a complex system and we want to make it different from what has already been done.

Align our lifestyle with what we really need and want to build in the future.

# 3 Music
Everything we do involves music.
We use music as a medium and not as an end, we live and work with soundtrack, we gather for a good jam session or just with a setlist to liven up the crowd.
We leave the stage open for all those who want to experiment and give a straw of their musical gifts, here anyone has place to manifest their artistic side.

What the gossip from the coworkers is about Coworking Casa Vermelhia:

""The best of the red house is the environment, a great place to work ""

""Being able to eat Mari's food every day is a great privilege!""

If you don't believe them then take up the offer of a trial day and check out the dynamic and energetic vibe of the place. This is where you can expand and improve your business networks through an environment where collaboration and interaction are an everyday asset to the workers.....you even get lunch.

Coworking Red House will boost your growth both personally and professionally in a pleasant and friendly environment. It attracts an eclectic and diverse group of individuals from wandering digital nomads to startups and entrepreneurs, as well as local professionals who thrive on the synergies presented.

There is a reception area to meet clients, a meeting room to invade when you need tete-a-tete time or a brainstorming session with team players, 2 private rooms that can accommodate 8 people each plus a shared office space for up to 20 coworkers at any one time. When you just need a breathe of fresh air, there is a luscious green outdoor area. You can choose from a spot at the shared table if you only need space for you and your laptop, or if you want to spread out there is ""The Chef's Table"" to take over.

The best perk of working at The Red House is that you don't have to worry about getting a balanced diet, as there are simple home-cooked meals on hand for only a pittance.
