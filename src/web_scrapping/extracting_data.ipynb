For a very reasonable price you can rent a very spacious desk and individual space that strike a great balance between privacy and interaction with fellow co-workers. The interior is very well taken care off with enough attention to detail to make you feel comfortable, yet without the frills that would only cause distraction.\n",

The spacious, fresh work space is a lovely place to come in the morning and its located in a very accessible area.\n",
      "Tired from working at home for years, Freeland was the answer to my troubles. Comfort, collaborations, social life, and productivity would be my four words of choice to describe working here.\n",

      "There is a great mix of businesses and freelancers from different job sectors and countries. The installations are lighthearted and functional, inspiring productivity without distractions.\n",

For a very reasonable price you can rent a very spacious desk and individual space that strike a great balance between privacy and interaction with fellow co-workers. The interior is very well taken care off with enough attention to detail to make you feel comfortable, yet without the frills that would only cause distraction.\n",

The spacious, fresh work space is a lovely place to come in the morning and its located in a very accessible area.\n",
