Whether you’re a solopreneur or a team plotting the next big tech revolution, Bond Flatiron is one of those workspaces that is as maximally equipped for chill time as it is for work. Among the perks Flatiron shares with its siblings Gowanus and Fidi - also in central New York locations - are 24 hour access, private phone booths, insanely fast internet, conference rooms equipped with the latest tech,scan-to-email, HD projectors, printer-copiers and a smooth modern, open design.

Once you’ve exhausted yourself with work, just pop up from your workspace and challenge someone to a showdown at foosball or ping pong. Less energetic chill-options include vegging out with video games, Cable TV or Netflix.

You can do that with a freshly brewed coffee, tea and gourmet eats - and for when you really need a drink, there is beer. Of course, with all these homely options, the common area might start getting a little too comfortable. Don’t sweat it though, there’s a quiet room with comfy chairs where you will be safe from temptation.

They say that ten years ago New York wasn’t exactly known for tech innovation. But today places like Bond Flatiron is host to a thriving start up scene - Mozilla, Alley Watch and 30 other companies have called this space home. If you want to see what it’s like to work out of this collaborative shared space, you can book a tour or rent a day pass. Also, check out their workshops, lectures, group events and networking mixers.

Coworking members have access to super-fast Wi-Fi, printing and photocopying facilities, a great big kitchen to whip up a snack in when the hunger pangs strike and plenty of electrical outlets to charge your gadgets.

Coworking memberships are totally flexible so that you can work whenever you want and based on an honor system. There are no dedicated desks or private offices, merely a desk space for you when you need it. The doors are open from 8am to 6.30pm Monday to Friday giving you the weekends to run around a park with your dog or to be a sloth at home. You will be given an access code so that you can key into the building giving you the freedom to come and go as you please.

As the community grows there are possibilities for afternoon yoga breaks, silent meditation (if you don't wish to contemplate your toes for time out) and workshops for sharing ideas. The best perk is the free warm cookies every Thursday afternoon.
