A shambled infrastructure, constant traffic, air pollution, violent crime, and extreme poverty makes for understandable wariness about moving to São Paulo. But once chipped away, many come to love this multicultural hub of South America – grievances, contradictions, and all.\n\nSão Paulo is ideal for having the benefits of a metropolis at your fingertips while getting to take part in the relaxed yet vibrant Brazilian lifestyle. The sprawling concrete jungle has incredibe pockets of beauty, activity, and diversity, and though the disparity between classes is obvious, paulistanos are known for their optimism and passion for life, however it’s lived. Though it’s often bypassed on the tourist track for Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo has some of Brazil’s best world-class restaurants, cultural and entertainment attractions, and gratifying stumbled-upon finds.\n\nFor the digital nomad, it doesn’t hurt that São Paulo is the largest financial center in all of South America with the most powerful startup ecosystem. And with an emergent middle class, the market size continues to grow. Today the city hosts innumerable entrepreneurship and tech events and has the largest number of cafes and coworking spaces to hustle from in Brazil.

With all the enthusiasm and opportunity surrounding the startup culture, this hub is as hot and addictive as doughy coxinhas fresh from the frying pan.\n\nMuch like Rio, the hoops of the rental process can be an incredible headache, amplified further by outrageous accommodation costs. A major reason for the high cost of living in São Paulo in particular is the lack of middle ground rental options. Expatriates tend to live in a limited number of expensive neighborhoods in the south and west zones of the city that have higher security and better infrastructure. Because of the hellish traffic, people choose to live close to their work, so properties near corporate hubs are significantly pricier.
